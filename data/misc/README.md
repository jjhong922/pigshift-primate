### DESCRIPTION ###

Miscellaneous external data files required for analyses that are not publicly available online.

1. `human-ensembl-hgnc-symbol-map.txt` contains a mapping of ENSEMBL gene names to HGNC gene symbols. I downloaded it from Biomart following the instructions on [this webpage](http://useast.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=125). In particular, I used the attributes "Ensembl Gene ID" and "HGNC Symbol" for Homo sapiens genes (GRCh38.p5).
2. I created `brawand-et-al-primate-tree.tre` the primate tree from the Brawand, et al. paper in  [`ape`](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/ape) format. See `brawand-et-al-primate-tree.pdf` for a drawing of the tree.
